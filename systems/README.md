# system design examples

general solutions for system design questions

oftentimes, companies will ask system design questions related to the type of business that they do. example: if you're applying for a social media company they may ask you to design twitter. there are a couple of problems that are really commonly asked questions:

- url shortener
- twitter
- banking transaction

the best way of studying for these is to study the broad concepts and try to reason through your bottlenecks. also since a lot of companies discuss their design patterns in engineering blogs, there is a ton of information on the internet about how these systems were scaled to be the way they are today and the roadblocks they faced. it's also good to broaden the type of system design questions you study (e.g. facebook / instagram / twitter are broadly really similar but twitter vs uber are quite different)
