# system design

a collection of resources i use to study for system design questions. like my [leetcode repo](https://github.com/MstrZhang/leetcode) this repo is also not being actively maintained. if you have any questions feel free to [email me](mailto:mstr.zhang@gmail.com) or DM me on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/mstrzhang)

the most comprehensive guide to learn system design questions is the [donne martin system design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) of which this repo is heavily inspired by. the donne martin guide is fantastic at giving you a breadth of information but some of the concepts are not explained very well. there are lot of other resources that go into much more detail on specific concepts but this guide covers a good baseline of broad things you should know

system design interviews are often formatted in a way in such that there is "no right answer" however there are some key points you should be hitting in every interview and there are a few baseline concepts you should probably understand. as a FED (frontend developer) by trade, a lot of these concepts don't pop up in my daily career (hence why i'm prepping for them here)
