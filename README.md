# system design

a collection of resources i use to study for system design questions. like my [leetcode repo](https://github.com/MstrZhang/leetcode) this repo is also not being actively maintained. if you have any questions feel free to [email me](mailto:mstr.zhang@gmail.com) or DM me on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/mstrzhang)

the most comprehensive guide to learn system design questions is the [donne martin system design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) of which this repo is heavily inspired by

system design interviews are often formatted in a way in such that there is "no right answer" however there are some key points you should be hitting in every interview and there are a few baseline concepts you should probably understand. as a FED (frontend developer) by trade, a lot of these concepts don't pop up in my daily career (hence why i'm prepping for them here)
